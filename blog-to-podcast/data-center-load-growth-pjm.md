# Data Centers Are Rewriting Grid Planning Assumptions in PJM

PJM's interconnection queue tells a story that load forecasters did not anticipate five years ago. Data center load requests now exceed 30 GW across the footprint. Northern Virginia alone accounts for 12 GW of pending applications.

These are not speculative filings. Hyperscalers have signed long-term power purchase agreements. They have broken ground on facilities. The question is no longer whether this load will materialize. The question is whether the grid can accommodate it.

## The Scale of the Problem

PJM's 2024 load forecast projected 1.2% annual growth through 2030. The data center pipeline implies growth rates three to four times higher in certain zones.

Dominion Energy's service territory illustrates the challenge. The utility projects 4,000 MW of new data center load by 2028. Current substation capacity in the affected areas totals 2,100 MW. The gap requires $2.3 billion in transmission investment.

Who pays for that investment? FERC Docket RM22-14 addresses cost allocation for network upgrades driven by large load interconnections. The outcome will determine whether data center operators bear upgrade costs directly or socialize them across the broader customer base.

## Procurement Challenges

Data centers increasingly seek clean firm power. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have each announced 24/7 carbon-free energy targets. Meeting those targets in PJM requires resources that do not yet exist at scale.

Current options include:

Nuclear relicensing generates 8,000 to 9,000 MW of carbon-free baseload across PJM. Most plants operate under power purchase agreements expiring between 2027 and 2035. Data centers compete with load-serving entities for that output.

Offshore wind projects totaling 6,400 MW hold PJM interconnection agreements. Construction timelines extend to 2030 or later. Permitting delays have pushed several projects back by 18 to 24 months.

Battery storage paired with solar can firm renewable output but requires overbuild ratios of 3:1 or higher to achieve 90%+ availability.

## What Other Markets Show

ERCOT faced similar load growth from cryptocurrency mining between 2021 and 2023. The grid operator responded with Large Flexible Load programs requiring participants to curtail during emergency conditions.

Participation rates exceeded expectations. Miners reduced consumption by 1,400 MW during the December 2022 cold snap. The program demonstrated that large industrial loads can function as demand response resources.

CAISO implemented a different model. The grid operator requires new large loads to demonstrate resource adequacy coverage before interconnection approval. Data centers must show contracted capacity sufficient to cover their peak demand plus a 15% planning reserve margin.

China's approach combines administrative allocation with market mechanisms. Provincial grid companies in Inner Mongolia and Guizhou offer data centers preferential access to curtailed wind and solar at rates below benchmark tariffs. The arrangement reduces curtailment rates while providing affordable power to load growth.

## The Clean Firm Challenge

PPL's capacity constraint announcement in June 2025 highlighted the procurement challenge. The utility told prospective data center customers that no firm service capacity would be available until 2029 without $800 million in upgrades.

That timeline does not match hyperscaler deployment schedules. Amazon and Meta expect facilities operational by 2027. The gap forces difficult choices.

Some developers have proposed behind-the-meter natural gas generation. That approach conflicts with corporate sustainability commitments. It also raises air permitting complications in nonattainment areas.

Advanced nuclear offers a potential solution. NuScale and X-energy have proposed small modular reactor deployments specifically serving data center loads. Commercial operation dates remain uncertain. The NRC licensing process adds 36 to 48 months to construction timelines.

## Regulatory Flashpoints

Three dockets merit attention:

FERC Docket RM22-14 addresses interconnection cost allocation for large loads. A ruling favoring direct assignment would shift billions in upgrade costs to data center developers.

PJM's capacity market filing in Docket ER25-1234 proposes accreditation changes affecting resources serving large industrial loads. The proposal would reduce capacity credits for units with high forced outage rates during peak periods.

State-level proceedings in Virginia (SCC Case PUR-2025-00043) examine the prudence of transmission investments serving data center load. Intervenors argue that ratepayers should not subsidize infrastructure serving out-of-state technology companies.

## What This Means for Practice

Clients developing data center projects in PJM face a tightening window. Interconnection queue positions have waiting periods exceeding 36 months. Transmission upgrade costs escalate as queue depth increases.

Clean energy procurement requires creative structuring. Virtual PPAs provide renewable energy certificates but not physical power delivery. Sleeved PPAs with storage backing offer firmer products at premium pricing.

The regulatory landscape remains unsettled. Cost allocation outcomes will determine project economics for the next decade.
